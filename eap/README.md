Back-end service code of voice assistant

### Install:

Before deploying the application, you need to install the project dependency

```shell
npm install
```

### Compile

Remember to **compile the TypeScript before uploading**. By default `dist` will be the output folder, and we build the EdgerOS app from there too.

```shell
npm run compile
```

### ESLint

Enforce code style and locate problems.

```shell
npm run lint
```
